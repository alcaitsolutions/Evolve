## Development Notes

### Architecture

There is a folder that is used for setting RadSideDrawer instance as an application starting point:

- `/app-root/app-root.js` - sets up the RadSideDrawer drawer content and defines navigation frame for the pages.

RadSideDrawer has the following component structure:

- `RadSideDrawer` - The component to display a drawer on the page.
- `RadSideDrawer.drawerContent` - Part of the RadSideDrawer, it holds a custom component `drawer` that displays the contents of the drawer.
- `RadSideDrawer.mainContent` - Part of the RadSideDrawer, it holds the main content for the page.

The template has the following blank pages:

- `/home/home-page.js`
- `/browse/browse-page.js`
- `/search/search-page.js`
- `/featured/featured-page.js`
- `/settings/settings-page.js`

### Styling

This template is set up to use SASS for styling. All classes used are based on the {N} core theme â€“ consult the [documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/theme.html#theme) to understand how to customize it. Check it out to see what classes you can use on which component.

It has 4 global style files that are located at the root of the app folder:

- `_app-variables.scss` - holds the global SASS variables that are imported on each component's styles.
- `_app-common.scss` - the global common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `app.android.scss` - the global Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
- `app.ios.scss` - the global iOS style sheet. These style rules are applied to iOS only.
